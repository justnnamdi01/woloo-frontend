Overall Requirements and Instructions
• You can use an external CSS library such as Bootstrap. Make sure the library
file or online link is included in the submission.
A submission could receive zero marks if it fails any of the
following requirements:
• [Front-End]
o the App must be implemented by using Vue.js framework. Other
frameworks or related technologies (e.g., React, AngularJS, Svelte,
Apache, XAMPP) are NOT allowed.
o Any JavaScript library is NOT allowed if it duplicates or replaces features
provided by Vue.js framework. Check with the tutor if not sure.
• [Back-End and Connection details for the Front-End]
o the Back-End server must use “Node.js”; others such as Apache or
Xampp are not allowed.
o in relation to hosting the Back-End server, it is not allowed to use AWS
S3, nor AWS EC2, nor other cloud-based hosting solutions (e.g.,
Heroku). The only allowed ones are AWS or render.com, with the
technologies covered in the related Lecture.
o the REST API must be developed with “Express.js”.
o the Front-End data access must be achieved with “promise” using “fetch”
function; “XMLHttpRequest” or library such as axios:js are not allowed.
o the data must be stored in “MongoDB Atlas” and retrieved via your
Express.js App; local MongoDB or any other databases are not allowed.

o connection to MongoDB (in your Express.js App) must use the native
Node.js driver only; libraries like Mongoose are not allowed.
Marking criteria
• General Requirements (20%):
A. [GitHub Repositories] the code of the Vue.js App must be hosted in a
GitHub repository, with at least 10 commits, and the code of the
Express.js App must be hosted in another GitHub repository, with at
least 10 commits (6% if 2 separated repositories are used, 3% if only 1
repository is used).
B. [GitHub Pages] the Vue.js App must be hosted and demonstrated on/via
GitHub Pages and connected (via Fetch) to your AWS (or render.com)
Express.js App (7% if requirement is fully covered, 3% if app is running
locally).

Amazon AWS ( https://aws.amazon.com/ ) or on Render
( https://render.com ) (7% if requirement is fully covered, 3% if the server
is run locally, 0% if the server is hosted in another cloud-based solution).
• [Front-End] “Display List of Lessons” functionality (7%):
A. there should be at least 10 lessons, and each lesson should have 5
spaces (or availability) (1%).
B. each lesson should have at least (5%): Subject (1%), Location (1%),
Price (1%), Spaces (or availability: this indicates how many spaces are

Full Stack Development 2024-25 CST3144
17
A. the user can choose to sort the lessons by one of the following attributes
(8%): subject (2%), location (2%), price (2%), or spaces (i.e. availability)

will add one space to the shopping cart, reducing the remaining space
by one (2%).
D. once there is no more space, i.e. space = 0, the “Add to cart” button
should be disabled but still visible, i.e. clicking it will not further reduce
“space” nor add lessons to the cart (1%).
• [Front-End] “Shopping Cart” functionality (5%):
A. the shopping cart button should only be enabled after at least one lesson
is added to cart (1%).
B. clicking the shopping cart button should show the cart page, and clicking
the button again goes back to the lesson page (1%).
C. the shopping cart, in the cart page, should show all the lessons added
(1%).

from the shopping cart; the removed lesson is added back to the lesson
list (in the lesson page) (2%).
• [Front-End] Checkout functionality (6%):
A. the checkout is part of the shopping cart page (not part of the lessons
page) (1%).
B. the “checkout” button is always visible and only enabled (clickable) after
valid “Name” and “Phone” are provided (2%).

the check must be done using JavaScript (suggestion: regular
expressions) (2%).
D. clicking the “checkout” button should display a message confirming the
order has been submitted (1%).
• [Front-End (and Back-End)] Search Functionality (10%):
• [Intro] This is the challenge component of this coursework, and it is not
expected that everyone can complete it. The solution is not fully covered in
the lecture or lab, so you need to research it.

• [Feature Description] The goal is to add a full-text search feature,
• The user can search for a lesson without specifying which attribute to search
on.
• For example, searching for “a” should return all the lessons with “a” in its
“title” or “location” or “price” or “availability”.
• Solutions provided are marked as follows.
[Base Marks (provided depending on which following approach is chosen)]
A. [Approach 1] (2%) “Implemented only in the Front-End”, you can implement
this feature using Vue.js and/or an existing JavaScript library (could not be
a Vue.js library).
OR
• [Approach 2] (7%) “Implemented functionally in the Back-End and
graphically in the Front-End”, the difference with “Approach 1” above is that
in this case the search needs to be performed in the Back-End (Express +
MongoDB), not directly and exclusively in the Front-End, but the Front-End
will receive (e.g., via REST API) results from the Back-End and manage the
graphical aspects for showing the search results. You cannot use any
existing library to implement this functionality. Otherwise, you will not
receive any mark for this part. The points for this approach are divided as
follows.
a. “Fetch and Visual Aspects” (3%), in the front end, a “fetch”
request should be created to send the search information
to the Back-End, and related filtered results obtained
should be shown in the Front-End.
b. “Express API” (4%), an Express.js route should be created
to handle the search request, and to return the search
results from the MongoDB. The student should implement
this as a GET route (“/search”), and should be able to test
it also without using the Front-End.
[Further Mark]
B. “search as you type” (3%), there is also this mark if the search supports
“search as you type”, i.e. the search starts when the user types the first letter
(displaying all the lessons containing that letter), and the result list is
dynamically filtered as more search letters are entered (similar to Google
Search).
• [Back-End] MongoDB should have (8%):
A. a collection for lesson information (minimal fields: topic, price, location,
and space) (4%).
B. a collection for order information (minimal fields: name,
phone number, lesson IDs, and number of space) (4%). Suggestion: the
element lessonIDs can contain 1 or more lesson IDs, depending on how
many different kinds of lessons you have in your order. Other solutions
could be accepted: in fact, how you design this is not the primary aspect

of this module, therefore it is up to you to find a reasonable solution that
works satisfactorily.
• [Back-End] Middleware Functions implemented in the Express.js Server
should include (8%):
A. a “logger” middleware that outputs all requests to the server console; the
student needs to be able to inspect and explain the log (4%).
B. a static file middleware that returns lesson images, or an error message
if the image file does not exist; the student needs to be able to test and
demonstrate these aspects (4%).
• [Back-End] REST API implemented in the Express.js Server should
include and be tested as indicated in the following (the student must be
able to test all the routes properly and explain them) (12%):
A. one GET route /lessons, which returns all the lessons as a Json,
demonstrated with a Postman request prepared in advance (3%).
Example:
[
{‘ topic’: ‘math’, ‘location’: ‘Hendon’, ‘price’: 100, ‘space’: 5},
{‘ topic’: ‘math’, ‘location’: ‘Colindale’, ‘price’: 80, ‘space’: 2},
{‘ topic’: ‘math’, ‘location’: ‘Brent Cross’, ‘price’: 90, ‘space’: 6},
{‘ topic’: ‘math’, ‘location’: ‘Golders Green’, ‘price’: 95, ‘space’: 7},
]
B. one POST route, which saves a new order to the “order” collection,
demonstrated with a Postman request prepared in advance (4%).
C. one PUT route, which can update any attribute in a lesson of the “lesson”
collection (suggestion/requirement: this will be used, after an order is
submitted, for updating the available spaces: updating to any number
the available spaces, and not just increasing or decreasing),
demonstrated with a Postman request prepared in advance (5% if the
requirement is fully covered, 2% if the solution is just increase or
decrease).
• [Front-End] Fetch Functions implemented in the Front-End should
include (9%):
A. one fetch that retrieves all the lessons with GET (3%).
B. one fetch that saves a new order with POST after it is submitted (3%).
C. one fetch that updates the available lesson space with PUT after an
order is submitted (3%).
